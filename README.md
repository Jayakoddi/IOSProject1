<p>( A  Bakery App )</p>

<p>I built this app for my brother-in-law, who owns a small bakery business in India, 
and I thought it would be fun to develop this app while exploring and sharing ideas to help his business in a small way. 
The process of building this app was both fun and challenging, and it provided me with valuable learning experiences.</p>
